\section{Introduction}
This specification documents features required by \pft to simulate physical and chemical processes within the subsurface environment. These required features are divided into functional and non-functional requirements. Functional requirements consist of physical or chemical processes, numerical methods, user interfaces, etc.  Non-functional requirements include runtime performance metrics (e.g. scalability,  performance), software maintenance and code availability. The specification maps these features to tests designed to verify their accuracy and robustness.

\section{Functional Requirements}
\pft’s functional requirements are divided into the following categories: constitutive relations, physics and chemistry, numerical methods, and user interaction.
\subsection{Constitutive Relations}

Constitutive relations employ mathematical equations to approximate the observed physical response of a material or fluid under conditions of interest. For instance, an equation of state calculates a fluid density as a function of input parameters pressure and temperature.

\setlist[enumerate]{label=CR \arabic*.,ref=CR \arabic*}
\subsubsection{Equations of State}
Equations of state calculate fluid density, enthalpy, and viscosity as a function of temperature and pressure. The following equations of state shall be implemented in the code:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \label{eos_water_ifc67} \pft shall implement the IFC67 (International Formulation Committee, 1967) equations of state for calculating the density, enthalpy, and viscosity of water as a function of pressure and temperature.
	\item \label{eos_water_eos_water_if97} \pft shall implement the IF97 from the International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam (Wagner et al, 2000) equations of state for calculating the density and enthalpy of water and steam as a function of pressure and temperature.
	\item \label{eos_water_constant} \pft shall implement an equation of state for water that holds the density, viscosity and enthalpy of water and steam constant regardless of pressure or temperature.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Capillary Pressure/Saturation Functions}
In variably saturated or multiphase flow in porous media it is essential to establish a relation between capillary pressure and saturation. This relation is set forth by several empirical models, and two of the more common are implemented in \pft:
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
	\item \label{vanGen} \pft shall implement the van Genuchten function (van Genuchten, 1980) to calculate the saturation on a cell given its capillary pressure value.
	\item \label{brCorey} \pft shall implement the Brooks-Corey function (Brooks and Corey,  1964) to calculate the saturation on a cell given its capillary pressure value.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Relative Permeability Functions}

Relative permeability functions establish a relationship between liquid relative permeability [-] (which varies from 0 to 1) and saturation.  
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
	\item \label{mualem} \pft shall calculate relative permeability as a function of saturation using either the Mualem-van Genuchten or the Mualem-Brooks-Corey functions (Chen et al. 1990). 
	\item \label{burdine} \pft shall calculate relative permeability as a function of saturation using either the Burdine-van Genuchten or the Burdine-Brooks-Corey functions (Chen et al. 1990). 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Soil Compressibility Functions}
The storage of fluid in porous media change according to compaction or expansion of fluids and porous media. While compaction (or expansion) of fluids is governed by the fluid compressibility, the changes in porous media volume is set forth by soil compressibility functions. These functions relate changes in porosity with changes in pressure. \pft shall implement the following soil compressibility functions:
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
	\item \label{leijnse} \pft shall calculate soil compressibility through the Leijnse function (Leijnse 1992). It calculates the current porosity as a function of pressure, given soil matrix compressibility coefficient, a reference pressure, and reference porosity.
	\item \label{exponential} \pft shall calculate soil compressibility through an exponential relationship between changes in pressure and porosity, given a soil matrix compressibility coefficient, a reference pressure, and reference porosity. (Low - easy)
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Constitutive Relation Coupling by Region}
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
	\item \pft shall allow for capillary pressure/saturation functions, relative permeability functions and soil compressibility functions to be specified by region. \label{CRbyRegion} (HIGH - easy)
