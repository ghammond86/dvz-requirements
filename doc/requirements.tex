\section{Introduction}
This specification documents features required by \pft to simulate physical and chemical processes within the subsurface environment. These required features are divided into functional and non-functional requirements. Functional requirements consist of physical or chemical processes, numerical methods, user interfaces, etc.  Non-functional requirements include runtime performance metrics (e.g. scalability,  performance), software maintenance and code availability. The specification maps these features to tests designed to verify feature accuracy.

	\assignbycellid \label{repMatPropCellID}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Constitutive Relations}
Constitutive relations employ mathematical equations to approximate the observed physical response of a material or fluid under conditions of interest. 
For instance, an equation of state calculates a fluid density as a function of input parameters pressure and temperature.

\setlist[enumerate]{label=CR \arabic*.,ref=CR \arabic*}
\subsubsection{Equations of State}
\pft shall incorporate the following equations of state:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \label{eos_water_ifc67} \pft shall implement the IFC67 (International Formulation Committee, 1967) equations of state for calculating the density, enthalpy, and viscosity of water as a function of pressure and temperature.
	\item \label{eos_water_eos_water_if97} \pft shall implement the IF97 from the International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam (Wagner et al, 2000) equations of state for calculating the density and enthalpy of water and steam as a function of pressure and temperature.
	\item \label{eos_water_constant} \pft shall implement an equation of state for water that holds the density, viscosity and enthalpy of water and steam constant regardless of pressure or temperature.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Saturation Functions}
In variably saturated or multiphase flow in porous media, it is essential to establish a relation between capillary pressure and saturation.
A saturation  function calculates the liquid or gas saturation as a function of capillary pressure and vice versa. 
\pft shall incorporate the following and saturation functions:
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
	\item \label{vanGen} \pft shall implement the van Genuchten function (van Genuchten, 1980) to calculate the saturation on a cell given its capillary pressure value.
	\item \label{brCorey} \pft shall implement the Brooks-Corey function (Brooks and Corey,  1964) to calculate the saturation on a cell given its capillary pressure value.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Relative Permeability Functions}
Relative permeability functions establish a relationship between fluid phase's  relative permeability, which ranges between 0 and 1, and its saturation. 
\pft shall incorporate the following relative permeability functions:
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
	\item \label{mualem_vg} Mualem-van Genuchten 
	\item \label{mualem_bc} Mualem-Brooks-Corey 
	\item \label{burdine_vg} Burdine-van Genuchten
	\item \label{burdine_bc} Burdine-Brooks-Corey.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Soil Compressibility Functions}
The volume of fluid stored in porous media can change due to pore compaction and fluid expansion. While compaction (or expansion) of fluids is governed by the fluid compressibility (e.g., through an equation of state), change in pore volume is set forth by soil compressibility functions, which relate porosity change to a shift in pressure. \pft shall implement the following soil compressibility functions:
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
