\section{Introduction}
This specification documents features required by \pft to simulate physical and chemical processes within the subsurface environment. These required features are divided into functional and non-functional requirements. Functional requirements consist of physical or chemical processes, numerical methods, user interfaces, etc.  Non-functional requirements include runtime performance metrics (e.g. scalability,  performance), software maintenance and code availability. The specification maps these features to tests designed to verify their accuracy and robustness.

\section{Functional Requirements}
\pft’s functional requirements are divided into the following categories: constitutive relations, physics and chemistry, numerical methods, and user interaction.
\subsection{Constitutive Relations}

Constitutive relations employ mathematical equations to approximate the observed physical response of a material or fluid under conditions of interest. For instance, an equation of state calculates a fluid density as a function of input parameters pressure and temperature.

\setlist[enumerate]{label=CR \arabic*.,ref=CR \arabic*}
\subsubsection{Equations of State}
Equations of state calculate fluid density, enthalpy, and viscosity as a function of temperature and pressure. The following equations of state shall be implemented in the code:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item IFC67: \label{ifc67} \pft shall implement the IFC67 (International Formulation Committee, 1967) equations of state for calculating the density, enthalpy, and viscosity of water as a function of pressure and temperature.
	\item IF97: \label{if97} \pft shall implement the IF97 from the International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam (Wagner et al, 2000) equations of state for calculating the density and enthalpy of water and steam as a function of pressure and temperature.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Capillary Pressure/Saturation Functions}
In variably saturated or multiphase flow in porous media it is essential to establish a relation between capillary pressure and saturation. This relation is set forth by several empirical models, and two of the more common are implemented in \pft:
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
	\item van Genuchten: \label{vanGen} \pft shall implement the van Genuchten function (van Genuchten, 1980) to calculate the saturation on a cell given its capillary pressure value.
	\item Brooks-Corey: \label{brCorey} The simulator may use the Brooks-Corey function (Brooks and Corey,  1964) to calculate the saturation on a cell given its capillary pressure value.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Relative Permeability Functions}

Relative permeability functions establish a relationship between liquid relative permeability [-] (which varies from 0 to 1) and saturation. The simulator shall implement the following relative permeability functions: 

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
	\item Mualem: \label{mualem} The simulator calculates relative permeability as a function of saturation using either the Mualem-van Genuchten or the Mualem-Brooks-Corey functions (Chen et al. 1990). 
	\item Burdine: \label{burdine} The simulator calculates relative permeability as a function of saturation using either the Burdine-van Genuchten or the Burdine-Brooks-Corey functions (Chen et al. 1990). 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Soil Compressibility Functions}
The storage of fluids in porous media change according to compaction or expansion of fluids and porous media. While compaction (or expansion) of fluids is governed by the fluid compressibility, the changes in porous media volume is set forth by soil compressibility functions. These functions relate changes in porosity with changes in pressure. \pft shall implement two soil compressibility functions:
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
	\item Leijnse: \label{leijnse} Leijnse function (Leijnse 1992) is the default soil compressibility function considered by the simulator. It calculates the current porosity as a function of pressure, given soil matrix compressibility coefficient, a reference pressure, and reference porosity.
	\item Exponential: \label{exponential} An exponential soil compressibility function establishes an exponential relationship between changes in pressure and porosity, given a soil matrix compressibility coefficient, a reference pressure, and reference porosity. (Low - easy)
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Constitutive Relation Coupling by Region}
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
	\item \pft shall allow for capillary pressure/saturation functions, relative permeability functions and soil compressibility functions to be specified by region. \label{CRbyRegion} (HIGH - easy)
\end{enumerate}

\setlist[enumerate]{label=NM \arabic*.,ref=NM \arabic*}
\subsection{Numerical Methods}

\subsubsection{Time Stepping}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Variable Time Stepping: \label{NMvarTS} \pft shall have the ability to vary the time stepping. The time stepping will depend on the initial time step size, the minimal and maximum time step size, and the maximum growth and reduction factor. The maximum time step size may change during the simulation time. Time steps are increased or reduced according to growth and reduction factor as a function of the number of iterations needed for convergence. HIGH - medium

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Nonlinear solvers}

	\item The software shall report convergence failure and cut the timesetp size if the maximum number of Newton iterations is reached. \label{nonlinearReport} LOW-easy
\end{enumerate}

Convergence may be verified by five different convergence criteria, named as follows:

	\item ATOL: \label{nonlinearATOL} Convergence is met when the 2-norm of residual is less than ATOL.
	\item DTOL:\label{nonlinearDTOL} DTOL establishes divergence when the 2-norm of the residual is greater than DTOL multiplied by the 2-norm of the initial residual (relative to the first Newton iteration).

	\item RTOL:\label{nonlinearRTOL} Convergence is met when the 2-norm of residual is less than RTOL multiplied by the 2-norm of the residual from the first Newton iteration.
	\item STOL:\label{nonlinearSTOL} Convergence is met when the 2-norm of the update (difference between the current and the previous iteration solution) is less than STOL multiplied by the 2-norm of the previous iteration solution.
\end{enumerate}
MEDIUM - easy

\subsubsection{Linear solvers}
The set of nonlinear governing equations is solved using Newton-Raphson’s method, which uses a sequence of linearized problems to find the solution. To solve this system of linear equations, \pft allows the use of two solvers: direct and iterative solvers. The direct solver uses an LU decomposition and iterative solver options are: Bi-CGStab (default), and GMRES. \pft allows the specification of the maximum number iterations. 
For iterative solvers, three types of convergence criteria shall be implemented:
\begin{enumerate}[resume]

	\item DTOL:\label{linearDTOL} DTOL establishes divergence when the 2-norm of the residual is greater than DTOL multiplied by the 2-norm of the initial residual (relative to the first linear iteration).
	\item RTOL:\label{linearRTOL} Convergence is met when the 2-norm of residual is less than RTOL multiplied by the 2-norm of the residual from the first linear iteration.
\end{enumerate}
MEDIUM - easy

\subsubsection{Finite volume implementation}
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
	\item The governing equations are discretized in \pft using a cell-centered finite volume approach, and a two-point flux approximation (TPFA) scheme is employed to discretize the mass flux between two grid cells. \label{FVmethod} 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Gridding}
\pft shall accept the following type of grids:
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
	\item Structured grids:  \label{structGrid} \pft has the capacity of creating structured cartesian grids of hexahedron cells with varying grid spacing.
	\item Implicit unstructured grids: \label{impStructGrid} An implicit unstructured grid allows the domain to be discretized with the following types of cells: tetrahedron (4 vertices), pyramid (5 vertices), wedge (6 vertices), and hexahedron (8 vertices). The implicit grid cells are defined by a list of vertices numbers and the vertices are defined by their coordinates.
	\item Explicitly unstructured grids: \label{expStructGrid} An explicit unstructured grid allows the domain to be discretized with all types of cells, including Voronoi cells. The grid is described by a list of cells and connectivity. Cells are defined by an id, the cell-center coordinates, and the cell volume. The connectivity between two cells is composed by the id for each cell, the area that connects the cells and the face-center coordinates.
\end{enumerate}

The simulation block is required in every input file. The remaining blocks define numerical methods, solver options, domain discretization, material properties, constitutive relations, time step options, output options, initial and boundary conditions and regions within the domain. \label{inputFile} LOW - easy
